    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, a simulated urban rescue situation is presented where students must develop an artificial intelligence system to assist a rescue team in finding the quickest and safest route to rescue people trapped in various locations of a city after a natural disaster. The city is represented by a grid where each cell can have different states: blocked, free, with trapped people, or with dangers. The rescue teams must consider both speed and safety during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply uninformed search algorithms (breadth-first and depth-first search) to find a path from the starting point to a rescue location.\n",
    "- Implement informed search strategies (A* and greedy search) using appropriate heuristics to optimize the rescue route considering time and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will put into practice the techniques for searching the state of spaces. To do that, some of the algorithms seen in units/lessons two and three will be implemented and used to solve a classical problem: searching paths in a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also analyze and compare the performance of the algorithms by running them over different instances of the problem, and providing distinct initial and goal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this practice helps you deepen your understanding of search strategies in artificial intelligence and encourages you to think about how these techniques can be applied in real-world situations to assist in rescue operations and other critical tasks. Good luck!\n"

    "  - Blocked: Cells impassable due to obstacles like debris or floods.\n",
